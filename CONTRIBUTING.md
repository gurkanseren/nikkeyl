## Pull Request Process

- **Contributing guidelines**

  - You have done your changes in a separate branch.
    Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either
    the `fix/`, `feature/` or `refactor` prefixes. Good examples are:
    `fix/paths`, `feature/postcss` or `refactor/gulpfile`.
  <!--  -->
  - You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).
  <!--  -->
  - You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).
  <!--  -->
  - Make sure that the code passes the check `remark`, `eslint`, `stylelint`,
  `editorconfig-checker`. If you encounter errors, fix the problems.
  <!--  -->
  - Ensure that all non-project files are deleted.
<!--  -->
- **After** these steps, you're ready to open a Pull Request.

  - Your Pull Request **MUST NOT** target the `main` branch on this repository.
    You probably want to target `fix`, `refactor` or `feature` branches instead.

    > **Important**<br>
    > Your Pull Request will be rejected if it targets the `main` branch.
  <!--  -->
  - Give a descriptive title to your Pull Request.
  <!--  -->
  - Describe your changes.
  <!--  -->
  - Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close
    the issue that your Pull Request fixes (if such).
  <!--  -->
  - You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off
    of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that,
    you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
